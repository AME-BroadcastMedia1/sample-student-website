        <p> My full name is Douglas Knight Singer.  I was the first in my family born in California.  My Dad had been in the Navy and he got his wish to be transferred to San Francisco.</p>
        <p>A couple years later we moved to the East Bay, where I grew up.  Then I went to UCLA, traveled Europe for a year, and got my MBA at the University of Oregon.</p>
        <p>After I got my Masters I moved back to Los Angeles to work for DreamWorks SKG in motion picture distribution.  I thorougly enjoyed my time there, although after six years decided it was time to find something else.</p>
        <p>In 2003, I got my teaching credential and in 2004 I moved back to San Francisco and started working at Burton High as a math teacher.  I was subsequently asked to teach business and digital media, due to my education and experience.  Working at Burton has been an incredible experience.  I love teaching because I'm always learning and meeting creative, motivated students!  </p>
